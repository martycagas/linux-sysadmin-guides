# Linux Sysadmin Guides

## What?

The culmination of all my notes I took during my time setting up and configuring a FOSS Linux mail server. For someone without any previous experience, it's a long and hard journey to do it right.

While I can't promise I did the best possible job, I can certainly write all of it down and share it with the world. Maybe that will give others the foundation to build on and create something better than I did. Maybe they will even add their experience to mine to let someone else start even better.

### Is this wiki for me?

Let's get some keywords off the way to see if this wiki is for you.

**Operating systems:**

- [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux)
- [Rocky Linux 8](https://rockylinux.org/)

**Mail transfer agents:**

- [Postfix](https://www.postfix.org/)

**Mail delivery agents:**

- [Dovecot](https://www.dovecot.org/)

**DNS servers:**

- [BIND](https://www.isc.org/bind/)

In essence, if the technology you need is listed, the guides take it into account. This may either mean that the listed approach applies also for the given technology, or the description of the ways the technology differs from the guide.

### Topics

The rough outline of topics this wiki covers:

- Hardware configuration
- OS installation
- OS configuration
- Software installation and configuration
- OS and software maintenance

## Where?

To get started, go to the wiki either through the button at the top of the page or follow [this link](https://github.com/martycagas/linux-sysadmin-guides/wiki).

## Why?

My first time setting up a mail server, I spent about 3 months on a task that was planned to take 3 weeks at most. I decided to do it right, rather than fast. Thus, the goal of this wiki is to provide clear, tried and truthful information for anyone out there tasked with the same goal. Doing this from the ground up and learning all the caveats through reading manuals and trial and error is a long and exhausting process. I believe it doesn't have to be.

## How?

The wiki tries to provide accurate information about what is either the industry standard, or, in the case the standard is slightly ambiguous, my best-effort solution. I highly welcome everyone to correct me on my mistake and improve my approaches. The reason I'm putting my notes here is to turn these guides into a collaborative effort.

Coming from this principle, the wiki tries to provide a few things:

- Sources the solutions are based on (if any, can include product documentation).
- Steps to quickly achieve the solution, if you're willing to take my word for it.
- The rationale behind the choices in the solution.
- A more in-depth explanation to help understand various issues the solution tries to tackle, hopefully helping to make the best educated decision.
